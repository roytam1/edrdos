7.01.08 WIP:
(30.5.2005):
- made XBDA=LOW properly handle the case when no upper memory chain is present
- added new config.sys COLOUR=xx,yy,zz to set the colour of foreground,
  background and border, respectively
- reserved more space in HMA for command.com to allow it to load high again
- added support for quoted strings in batch file arguments
- fixed BPB (BIOS parameter block) for unformatted FAT32 partitions
- fixed free space handling for FAT32 drives without File System Info Block,
  added safeguard against invalid FS Info Block
- added alternate keys <CR> and <SPACE> to answer (Y/N) question for F8-single-
  stepping and queries (? command) in config.sys; changed these routines to
  beep if wrong key has been pressed instead of simply selecting 'no'
- added option to run through the rest of config.sys in single-stepping mode by
  hitting the R or <ESC> key
(4.7.2005):
- made VOL and DIR commands skip LFNs when looking for the volume label
- changed delete file routine to also delete all LFNs preceding a dir entry
- made dir removal routine regard LFNs as empty when checking if a dir is still
  in use
- made file rename/move routine delete LFNs both for old and new entry
- fixed bug that caused the COLOUR command in config.sys to be repeated
  endlessly when it was used in single-stepping or query mode
- changed CLS command to use the colours set with the COLOUR command again
  after clearing the screen
- made COLOUR command also apply the new fore and background colour to the
  screen immediately
- also added alternate keys and run-through option to the single-stepping mode
  of autoexec.bat
(6.12.2005):
- added support for decompressing DRDOS.SYS files compressed with Pack v1.00
- added option /F to SWITCHES command, restructured config.sys processing to
  wait for F5/F8 keys after SWITCHES has been processed
- fixed bug in disk R/W routine that failed to update the LBA block number for
  subsequent read/write attempts if the previous transfer was only partially
  completed
- fixed bug in partition login routines that caused dedicated LBA partitions
  (type 0C/0Eh) within the CHS boundaries to be logged as CHS partitions
- made control flow commands GOTO/GOSUB/RETURN/EXIT/SWITCH persistent in most
  config.sys phases to make them work with (HI)INSTALLLAST
- changed routine for SWITCH command to remember the option the user selected
  in the main config.sys pass to keep it from asking again
- fixed bug that caused DR-DOS to hang on delete/rename operations when the
  boundary to the previous directory cluster was crossed while looking for
  preceding LFN entries
(15.1.2006):
- fixed bug that caused delete file operation to fail in every second cluster
  in a directory chain
- added preliminary support for 64-bit file systems
- added support for the FAT+ filesystem extension that allows files of up to
  256 GB
- added new function int 21h/AX=7142h (Long LSEEK) to allow 64-bit file pointer
  positioning
- placed additional check in read/write routine to ensure that files cannot
  become larger than the FAT+ limit (256 GB - 1)
- changed function 4E/4Fh (Find First/Next) to report a maximum file size of
  4 GB - 1
(20.8.2006):
- fixed bug in new function 7142h that caused the seek direction parameter to
  be lost
- fixed bug that caused the carry flag to be cleared when an unsupported sub
  function of DOS function 71/73h was called, causing some LFN-aware programs
  to assume that the LFN API was present
- fixed another bug in function 7142h that caused register DS not to be
  restored
- fixed yet another bug in function 7142h that caused positioning relative to
  the end of the file to change the file size instead of the file pointer
- fixed bug in free disk space computation routine that caused the next drive
  letter to become inaccessible until reboot
- added functions int 21h/AX=71A6 (Get File Info) and 21h/AX=71A7,BL=01
  (Convert DOS time to 64-bit Windows time)

7.01.07:
- added FAT32 support to the BDOS loader to allow booting from FAT32 partitions
- added support for category code 48h (FAT32) to generic ioctl function,
  changed get and set subfunctions to use extended BPBs again, but only for
  this category
- fixed bug in device driver initialization code that called driver interrupt
  routine without checking whether its offset had been changed by the strategy
  routine, causing Himem64 to hang after unpacking
- added DOS 7 system call int 21h/AH=73h, implemented sub function 7303h (Get
  Extended Free Disk Space)
- changed dir command to use the new free disk space routine when it is
  available and kilobytes instead of bytes for large numbers
- fixed some small Watcom C/C++ 11.0c compilation problems
- fixed bugs in disk device driver that caused Get/Set Media routines to not
  read/write the serial number and label correctly on FAT16 and LBA drives

  labels not to be found when other attributes were also given
- fixed bug in SynchroniseBuffers routine that sometimes caused data
  inconsistensies between buffers and disk
- restructured DR-DOS DDSC to make it more compatible with DOS 7 Extended DPB
  structure
- implemented function 7302h (Get Extended DPB)
- added alternate implementation of the int 25h/26h absolute disk read/write
  interface via function 7305h, for the few silly programs that try to use the
  so-called "extended" interface without checking if it is present
- changed the behaviour of functions 1Fh and 32h (Get DPB) to return error code
  FFh (invalid drive) for FAT32 drives; again, this was needed because some
  programs rely on this function to identify FAT32 drives
- changed OEM version code in function 30h from 00h (PC DOS) to EEH (DR DOS),
  changed true version as reported by function 3306h to 7.01, let SetVer
  override this as well to make Scandisk activate its FAT32 functionality
- added drive locking/unlocking functions to the disk device driver that fake
  a successful operation to make Scandisk work again after version change
- reduced maximum cluster size reported by function 36h for FAT32 partitions to
  32K to improve compatibility with existing disk tools.
- removed a rather dirty hack that was needed to work around a bug in the
  DR-DOS 7.03 boot sector code
- fixed bugs related to STACKS command
- added code to allow buffers, files, fcbs, stacks and drive table to be loaded
  in upper or high memory.
- added new config.sys commands HIFILES, HIFCBS, HISTACKS and HILASTDRIVE to
  load these data structures high even if DOS itself is loaded low
- added support for function 3001h (Get Version Flag) which is needed by
  Windows 3.x
- worked around a bug in MASM that led to errors in the DR-DOS header which was
  the reason why the taskswitcher refused to start
- fixed bugs in command.com to make comparisons in batch files with quoted
  strings work as expected
- added support for environment and internal variables on the command line
- changed function 49h (Free Memory) to merge adjacent free blocks after
  freeing a memory block
- fixed an overflow error that prevented DR-DOS from reading/writing files if
  the seek position was larger than (partition_size modulo 4 GB)
- made command.com stay resident even if not invoked with parameter /P when no
  other primary shell is installed, removed default parameters A: /P
- changed DEVICE command to not insert unnessary spaces into device driver's
  command line
- added new experimental config.sys command VERSION=x.x to allow to change the
  global version setting
- added support for block device drivers that are loaded with INSTALL in
  config.sys by increasing the number of drive letters available at boot time
  and copying the temporary logical drive table into the final one
- made some arrays in command.com static to keep nested IF commands in batch
  files from overflowing the stack
- added experimental support for drives with 128 KB cluster size (sectors per
  cluster in boot sector = 0)
- added new code to allow DDSC structures to be relocated to upper or high
  memory, added new config.sys command DDSCS=HIGH,UMB to configure this feature
  (default is DDSCS=LOW)
- added new code to also allow the DOS data segment to be relocated to upper
  memory, added new config.sys command DOSDATA=UMB to activate this (default is
  DOSDATA=LOW)
- added new code to allow the Extended BIOS Data Area to be relocated to low or
  upper memory if for some reason the memory manager fails to do this, added
  new config.sys command XBDA=LOW,UMB
- fixed a bug in the FAT32 FSInfo block handling routines that manifested after
  the DDSC relocation feature had been introduced
- fixed age-old OpenDOS bug that caused wrong value to be used for code segment
  padding which made DR-DOS hang during boot when loaded low on some machines
- made command.com ignore leading semicolons in %PATH% environment variable
- changed location of static arrays in command.com to another segment to work
  around what seems to be a bug in TaskMgr
- changed boot code so that DR-DOS will look for ibmdos.com and config.sys on
  the correct drive when booting from a second primary partition
- changed history and deblock buffer setup routines to use upper mem for these
  buffers if available
- changed FILES/FCBS to use upper memory by default if available
- changed number of internal file handles in the DOS header to four, remooved
  now obsolete command line buffer size hack
- changed floppy disk BPB table in init to use old-style BPB structure
- fixed command.com stack corruption problem when PATH is longer than 256 bytes
- fixed yet another bug from OpenDOS times that caused the RENAME command to
  corrupt the command.com stack if the new filename was longer than eight bytes
- fixed a stupid bug present since v7.01.04 that referenced some internal LBA
  variables via the wrong segment register, causing FORMAT to crash upon
  completion in recent versions with DOSDATA relocation
- introduced two new config.sys commands INSTALLLAST and HIINSTALLLAST that
  load programs after the DOSDATA segment relocation to work around problems
  with older programs that are incompatible with this feature when INSTALLed
- enhanced the VERSION=x.xx,y.yy config.sys command to also allow setting the
  True DOS Version as reported by function 3306h
- fixed code in command.com module cmdlist to work with Watcom C; changed
  default compiler for cmdlist from Borland C to Watcom C
- added support for DR-DOS 7.03 internal vars %_YEAR%, %_MONTH%, %MOY%, %_DAY%,
  %DOM%, %_DOW%, %_DOWI%, %_HOUR%, %_MINUTE%, %_SECOND%, %ERRORLEVEL%,
  %ERRORLVL%, %_ROWS%, %_COLUMNS%, %_COUNTRY% and %_CODEPAGE% to command.com
- changed the names for the kernel files to DRBIO.SYS and DRDOS.SYS; changed
  official name to "Enhanced DR-DOS"
- enhanced IF statement to also allow letters instead of numbers in ERRORLEVEL
  tests, i.e. IF ERRORLEVEL A translates into IF ERRORLEVEL 1

  driver
- expanded sector numbers in buffer management routines from 24 to 32 bit to
  allow partitions larger than 8 GB
- added FAT32 specific entries to DR-DOS file system structures
- rewrote most file system routines to cope with 32-bit cluster numbers and
  dynamic root directories (FAT32)
