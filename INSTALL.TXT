To install the binaries, create a directory on your hard disk and copy the
archive there. You can then unpack it with unzip32 or any other tool that can
unpack ZIP archives. From this directory, you can either use the makeboot batch
file to create a boot disk, e.g. makeboot a: will make a boot disk of the disk
in drive a:, or you can just copy the three files drbio.sys, drdos.sys and
command.com on any existing DR-DOS 7 boot disk and use the DR SYS tool to write
a new boot sector to the disk. DR SYS is available as a separate package. You
can also copy these files to your hard disk, but make sure you have a boot disk
to be able to reinstall your old DOS in case there is a problem. Also, please
read bugs.txt before you proceed.

To compile the source code, create a directory and copy dossrc.zip and any
patches you want to use there, then unzip the files with unzip32 or any other
tool that can unpack ZIP archives. Make sure you have the patch utility in your
path, then apply the patches by typing "patch -p1 <dr7010x.dif", where x is the
minor version number, up to the required number in consecutive order. Depending
on which patches you want to apply, you might have to change the names of some
sub directories to match those in the patch. Before you can compile the source
code, you have to edit the make.bat file in the directories drbio, drdos and
command to adjust the locations of your your MASM and Watcom files if
necessary. Then you can run make.bat in these directories to compile the source
code. The resulting binaries will be in the sub directory "bin". To boot the
compiled version of Enhanced DR-DOS, the files drbio.sys, drdos.sys and
command.com have to be copied on a bootable Enhanced DR-DOS disk. If you do not
have one, you will find a disk image in the archives containing the precompiled
binaries. Alternatively, you can create one yourself by using DR SYS to install
an Enhanced DR-DOS boot sector to any formatted disk.
