The DR-DOS/OpenDOS Enhancement Project

Many PC users in the world use DR-DOS because of its advanced features.
Unfortunately, the development of DR-DOS seems to have stopped and the last
version was released more than three years ago. Since there is currently no
other PC operating system that combines so many useful features with full PC
compatibility, I have decided to write my own set of patches for DR-DOS to
fix some bugs and add support for new standards.
Since the source code of later versions of DR-DOS is not freely available, I
have decided to use the source code of DR-DOS 7.01, better known as OpenDOS, as
the base for my work.
You will find the latest patches at http://www.drdosprojects.de, the project's
official web site. Since it has now got its own domain, this should not change
anymore.

To use the supplied patches, you need the following:
- a copy of the original Caldera OpenDOS 7.01 source code archive (DOSSRC.ZIP)
- a tool capable of unpacking ZIP archives
- a utility to apply the patches to the source
- the development tools MASM 6.0b and Watcom C/C++ 10.0a (other versions may
  work as well, but this has not been tested)

For those who do not want to compile the source code themselves or lack the
necessary development software, there are also pre-compiled binaries available.

Please note that you need to obtain a license from Caldera if you plan to use
OpenDOS for commercial purposes. The license agreement is found in license.txt
in the dossrc.zip archive. This license does still apply for the patched
versions, except that you should not contact Caldera tech support on matters
specific to the modified version.

If you use these patches or the precompiled binary versions on my web site, you
do it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage that might occur
to your hardware or data from using them.
Due to the experimental nature of these patches and lack of time on my side, I
cannot provide extensive technical support for them. However, if you find a bug
that I have not been aware of or if you want to tell me something that you
think I should know, you can post a message in
- the DR-DOS forum at http://senac.com/forums/4356/ or
- the german DR-DOS forum at http://www.senac.com/forums/11868/
which I usually check at least once in a few days.
