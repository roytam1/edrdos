The DR-DOS/OpenDOS Enhancement Project

Many PC users in the world use DR-DOS because of its advanced features.
In mid 2002, however, the development of DR-DOS seemed to have stopped and the
last version had been released more than three years ago. Since there is no
other PC operating system that combines so many useful features with full PC
compatibility, I decided to write my own set of patches for DR-DOS to fix some
bugs and add support for new standards.
Since the source code of later versions of DR-DOS was not freely available, I
decided to use the source code of DR-DOS 7.01, better known as OpenDOS, as
the base for my work.
Originally, I had only planned to make minor modifications to DR-DOS 7.01, like
adding support for large disks, fix some bugs, etc., but with each successive
version, the scope of the project increased, thereby extending the original
concept of DOS.

You will find the latest patches at http://www.drdosprojects.de, the project's
official web site. Since it has got its own domain, this should not change
anymore.

To use the supplied patches, you need the following:
- a copy of the original Caldera OpenDOS 7.01 source code archive (DOSSRC.ZIP)
- a tool capable of unpacking ZIP archives
- a utility to apply the patches to the source
- the development tools MASM 6.0b and Watcom C/C++ 10.0a (other versions may
  work as well, but this has not been tested)

Note that the source code patches are cumulative, meaning that you have to
apply the earlier patches to the source code as well, with the exception of
Work-In-Progress (WIP) and Release Candidate (RC) versions; these refer to the
previous main release version.

For those who do not want to compile the source code themselves or lack the
necessary development software, there are also pre-compiled binaries available.

OpenDOS had originally been released by Caldera under a commercial license, and
it is still bound to this license. If you plan to use OpenDOS for commercial
purposes, you need a commercial license for it from either Caldera or the
company that now owns DR-DOS/OpenDOS, DeviceLogics (or like they seem to call
themselves now, DRDOS, Inc.).
The original Caldera license agreement is in the file license.txt, and it also
applies for any modified versions that you can download here, as far as they
are based on OpenDOS, except that you should not contact their tech support on
matters specific to the modified versions. You should read license.txt before
you start using any of them.

If you use these patches or the precompiled binary versions on my web site, you
do it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage that might occur
to your hardware or data from using them.
Due to the experimental nature of these patches and lack of time on my side, I
cannot provide extensive technical support for them. However, if you find a bug
that I have not been aware of, or if you want to tell me something that you
think I should know, you should post a message in
- the Enhanced DR-DOS forum at http://www.senac.com/forums/16612/ or
- the German DR-DOS forum at http://www.senac.com/forums/11868/
which I usually check at least once in a few days. These forums are also an
excellent place to ask any other DR-DOS related questions or discuss any DR-DOS
topics with other members of the DR-DOS community.
